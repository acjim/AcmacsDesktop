	Antigenic Cartography for Desktop
	[Antigenic Cartography](http://www.antigenic-cartography.org/) is the process of creating maps of antigenically variable pathogens. 
	In some cases two-dimensional maps can be produced which reveal interesting information about the antigenic evolution of a pathogen.
	This project aims at providing a desktop application for working with antigenic maps.
