# Antigenic Cartography for Desktop
[Antigenic Cartography](http://www.antigenic-cartography.org/) is the process of creating maps of antigenically variable pathogens. In some cases two-dimensional maps can be produced which reveal interesting information about the antigenic evolution of a pathogen.

This project aims at providing a desktop application for working with antigenic maps.

## Run the application in development mode
You need ``npm`` installed in order to get this working. The best way to install ``npm`` is to install [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) using its installer.
### Install project dependencies
In the root folder of your app, run the following command.
```
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Start your app
Either download and install [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/), then simply drag and drop the whole AcmacsDesktop folder on the ``nw.exe``.

Or you can install nw.js through npm:
```
npm install -g nw
```
Now you can type ``nw <PathToApp>`` to start any of your projects. Keep in mind that now you will only have one nw version for all your projects.
