# Antigenic Cartography for Desktop [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acjim/AcmacsDesktop.svg?branch=testing)](https://travis-ci.org/acjim/AcmacsDesktop) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/e45c7f2631ad4267b4b91b5c30fefe87)](https://www.codacy.com/app/acjim/AcmacsDesktop)

[Antigenic Cartography](http://www.antigenic-cartography.org/) is the process of creating maps of antigenically variable pathogens. In some cases two-dimensional maps can be produced which reveal interesting information about the antigenic evolution of a pathogen.

This project aims at providing a desktop application for working with antigenic maps.

## Run the application in development mode
You need ``npm`` installed in order to get this working. The best way to install ``npm`` is to install [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) using its installer.
### Install project dependencies
In the root folder of your app, run the following command.
```
npm install
```

### Update project dependencies
If you already got the application running, but some dependencies changed, type:
```
npm update
```

### Start your app
```
npm start
```

## Build Instructions

### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
### Run Grunt
The task runner grunt creates a folder `cache`, downloads the right nw.js version and puts the final app into the `build` folder.
```
grunt
```
